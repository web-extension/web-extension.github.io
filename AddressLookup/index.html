  This example shows how to call a REST API and handle the response.<br>
  The "Lookup" button was dynamically added by WebExtension when this page was loaded.<br>
  When you click the button, an AddressLookup REST API is called through a HTTP proxy.<br>
  Once the responce came back successfully, the address in the response is set to the form on this page.
